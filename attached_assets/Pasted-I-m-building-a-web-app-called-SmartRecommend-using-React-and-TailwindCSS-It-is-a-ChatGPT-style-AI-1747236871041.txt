I'm building a web app called "SmartRecommend" using React and TailwindCSS. It is a ChatGPT-style AI assistant that helps users with credit cards, travel, hotels, and shopping. The home UI is clean, light-themed, and has a top navbar, a central chatbot area, and a fixed input bar at the bottom — like ChatGPT.

I want the app to dynamically switch UI when a user selects a different module (Travel, Hotel, Shopping, or Default/Home).

Please help me generate static XML mockups for each module to simulate the UI structure. Each mockup should:

1. Preserve the same assistant layout (top bar, main panel, bottom prompt input).
2. Render module-specific cards in the main panel.
3. Mimic what the user would see when the assistant is responding in that module.

Here are the module-specific mockups I want:

---

🔹 **Default (Home)**:
- A welcome card that says:
  "Hi there! 👋 I'm your Smart Lifestyle Assistant. I can help you find the perfect credit card, book flights, discover hotels, or find shopping deals. What would you like help with today?"
- Below that, show 4 category suggestion chips:
  - Credit card for travel
  - Budget flights Mumbai-Delhi
  - Hotels in Goa under ₹5000
  - Electronics under ₹1000

---

🔹 **Travel Module**:
- Title: "Top Flight Deals ✈️"
- Cards:
  - Flight from Mumbai to Delhi — ₹3,500 — 10% off on Axis Card
  - Flight to Goa — ₹4,200 — Flat ₹500 off with HDFC
  - Business class to Bangalore — ₹9,800 — 20% off on Amex

---

🔹 **Hotel Module**:
- Title: "Recommended Hotels 🏨"
- Cards:
  - Lemon Tree, Goa — ₹4,800/night — Rating: 4.2 ⭐ — Free breakfast
  - Taj Palace, Mumbai — ₹12,000/night — Rating: 4.9 ⭐ — 25% off with ICICI
  - FabHotel Pune — ₹2,500/night — Budget pick

---

🔹 **Shopping Module**:
- Title: "Top Deals for You 🛍️"
- Cards:
  - Noise Smartwatch — ₹1,999 — Amazon — 5% cashback on SBI
  - JBL Earbuds — ₹2,699 — Flipkart — 10% off with Kotak
  - Basic Electronics Combo — ₹899 — Deal of the Day

Each XML mockup should:
- Use clear tags like `<ModuleView>`, `<Card>`, `<Title>`, `<Price>`, `<Offer>`, `<Platform>`, etc.
- Be static (no JS, just mock structure)
- Feel visually like a UI wireframe structure of what the user would see

When I type:  
"Show me Travel UI"
